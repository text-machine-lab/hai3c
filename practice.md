Beyond science, we study **creative workflows** in:
- **Design & engineering:** ideation matrices, constraint play, failure-mode exploration
- **Arts & writing:** associative leaps, style transfer as concept scaffolding
- **Education:** rubrics for divergent/convergent thinking, critique-driven refinement
- **Policy & product:** structured deliberation, scenario planning

We aim to generalize **representations of creative moves** (diverge → transform → converge) that transfer across domains, while keeping each field’s evaluation rubrics.
