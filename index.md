subtitle: Crowdsourcing scientist–LLM interactions to train and evaluate creative reasoning

We are building a community of researchers and practitioners who believe **human–AI co-creativity** can accelerate conceptual breakthroughs—especially in **theoretical sciences** where progress hinges on *ideas*, not data collection.

**Our goals**
- **Train** models to be better scientific collaborators by learning from structured records of **scientist–LLM problem-solving sessions**.
- **Evaluate** models on **open-ended creative tasks**, with transparent leaderboards inspired by Chatbot Arena (coming soon).

**How to participate**
- **Sign up for the beta** to try our guided problem-solving flows and contribute interaction data: [Join the Beta →](/join/)
- Share use-cases or join discussions: [Discussion →](https://github.com/<your-username>/haicc-site/discussions)
- See focus areas: [Science →](/science/) · [Practice & Innovation →](/practice/)
