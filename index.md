### Human–AI Co-Creativity Consortium (HAI3C)

The **Human–AI Co-Creativity Consortium (HAI3C)** brings together researchers and practitioners exploring how **humans and large language models can co-create scientific insight**.  Our mission is to build the infrastructure, datasets, and evaluation frameworks needed to train AI systems that think *with* us — not just *for* us. 

We would like our models to be better scientific collaborators by learning from structured records of **scientist–LLM problem-solving sessions**.

### 🧠 Creative Problem Solving in Science

We are building a community of researchers and practitioners who believe **human–AI co-creativity** can accelerate conceptual breakthroughs, especially in **theoretical sciences** where progress hinges on *ideas*, rather than experimental work and data analysis.

Our current focus is to:

- capture **interactive trajectories** rather than isolated answers,  
- model **creative exploration**, and  
- design benchmarks that measure progress toward **creative problem solving** in scientific discovery.

### Participate

We’re running a **closed beta** of our guided problem-solving interface.  
You can help by contributing your own human–LLM sessions.

- **Sign up for the beta:** [Join the Beta →](/join/)  
- **Share use-cases or join discussions:** [Discussion →](https://github.com/text-machine-lab/hai3c/discussions)  
- **Explore other focus areas:** [Science →](/science/) · [Practice & Innovation →](/practice/)

### Future Plans

- **Public benchmark** for creative reasoning and collaborative problem solving  
- **Arena platform** for evaluating LLMs on open-ended creative tasks  
- **Community data contributions** to capture reasoning episodes and “breakthrough points”  

Follow development and discussions on our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/text-machine-lab/hai3c/discussions).
