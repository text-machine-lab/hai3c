## Human–AI Co-Creativity Consortium (HAIC3C)

The **Human–AI Co-Creativity Consortium (HAI3C)** brings together researchers and practitioners exploring how **humans and large language models can co-create scientific insight**.  
Our mission is to build the infrastructure, datasets, and evaluation frameworks needed to train AI systems that think *with* us — not just *for* us.*

We aim to make models better scientific collaborators by learning from structured records of **scientist–LLM problem-solving sessions**.
