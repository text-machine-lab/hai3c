title: Creative Problem Solving in Science
permalink: /science/
---

We focus on **theoretical sciences** (math, theoretical CS, physics, etc.) where progress centers on definitions, conjectures, reductions, constructions, heuristics, and proof strategies.

**What we collect (beta)**
- **Task briefs** (problem framing, priors, constraints)
- **Interaction transcripts** (curated “episodes” with turns, branches, rationales)
- **Milestones** (new lemmas, promising directions, dead-ends)
- **Outcome labels** (novelty, utility, correctness proxy, “breakthrough points”)

**Why this matters**
- **Training:** episodes become **instructional curricula** for creative reasoning, not just short Q&A.
- **Evaluation:** we score *creative moves* and *trajectory quality*, not only final answers.

**Roadmap**
- v0 (now): recruit beta testers and pilot the schema with guided prompts
- v1: public **benchmark + leaderboard** for creative scientific tasks
- v2: open **Arena** for model-vs-model co-creative sessions (observer-rated)
