**What we collect (beta):** voluntary sign-ups; interaction episodes (text only); annotations.  
**How we use it:** research on human–AI creativity; training and evaluating models; aggregate reporting.  
**Your choices:** per-episode consent tier:
- **Public dataset (CC BY 4.0)** – shareable with attribution  
- **Research-only** – non-public; accessible to vetted researchers  
- **Private** – used only for internal evaluation, not for training

We remove direct identifiers you provide in text. You may request deletion of your records by contacting us using the email you used to enroll.
